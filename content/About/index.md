I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the <u>[University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/)</u>. During my studies, I developed a strong interest in system and network security. I then had the chance to work on a European <u>[blockchain project](https://www.ecteg.eu/projects/blockchain-project/)</u> at <u>[Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu/)</u> (FBK), a leading research institute in Italy.  
Because of my experiences, I plan to pursue a career in Cyber Risk Strategy and Governance.
